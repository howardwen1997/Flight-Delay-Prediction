# Flight-Delay-Prediction

Final project for CSCI 5525: Advanced Machine Learning at University of Minnesota by Adam Bilski, Sam Penders, and Hung-Da Wen.

Predicting flight delays with deep learning.

## Data

The dataset is contained in the data/ directory. The LSTM data is too large to host on github, so is hosted on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gm5NuXvK8YTDuJRBm9FJOSKZhtRldLp7/view).

Data pre-preprocessing Jupyter notebooks are located in `data_preprocessing/`

## Multi-Layer Perceptron

MLP models are defined in `models/FlightMLP.py` and trained with `models/train_mlp.py`.

## LSTM

The LSTM model files are located in `models/LSTM*`.
